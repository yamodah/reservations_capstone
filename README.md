## Link to deployed app
https://reservations-yassine.herokuapp.com/ contains a live version of the app. Please allow up to 30 seconds for initial loading (hosted on free heroku server).

## Documentation for the API

The API of the app adheres to RESTful conventions. It has the following endpoints & requires all requests to be in JSON format:

/reservations
Accepts GET and POST requests

GET requests - must contain either a mobile_number or a data query parameter, i.e. /reservations?mobile_number=xxx-xxx-xxx or /reservations?date=YYYY-MM-DD. Will return an array of reservations matching the search parameters.

POST requests - creates a new reservation, requires a set of fields including first_name, last_name, mobile_number, reservation_date, reservation_time, people, and status. Returns the new reservation as saved in the database.

/reservations/:reservation_id
Accepts GET and PUT requests

GET requests - returns the single reservation with the requested id. No body is needed in the request.

PUT requests - updates the requested reservation, though the request must satisfy the requirements for creating a new reservation including required fields.

/reservations/:reservation_id/status
Accepts PUT requests

PUT requests - updates only the status for a given reservation, as when seated, cancelled, or finished.

/tables
Accepts GET and POST requests

GET requests - Provides an array including every table.

POST requests - Creates a new table, which requires a table_name and a capacity, which must be an integer.

/tables/:table/seat
Accepts PUT and DELETE requests

PUT requests - This adds a reservation_id to the table, which indicates which party is seated there.

DELETE requests - This removes the reservation_id from the table, and changes the status of the reservation to "finished"
